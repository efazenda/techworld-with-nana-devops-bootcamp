Different IT Roles in SOftware Development & Delivery Process

* Software Development
* Software Testing
* Operations

Traditional : Development vs Operation 

The developpement focus on imprement new features fast versus the Operations are more focus on maintaining stability
They have different responsabilities, different technical knowledge, different toolsets

Development : 

* programming languages
* test frameowrks
* databases
* version control 

Operations : 

* OS, mostly Linux
* command-line
* scripting 
* monitoring tools

Deployment requires configurations & environment needs to be prepared, so communication is important
In reality silos between those 2 departments
There are misscomunication and lack of collaboration, conflict of interest and too many manual work and checklists 

All of these slows down the release process !

The solution is the Devops Culture 

Simplified Definition : (Intersection of Development & Operations)

* DevOps was just a way of working between DEV's and OP's 
* Common language to communicate

Better Definition : (DevOps is about making the process of continuous delivery fast and with minimal errors)

* Devops tries to remove all these roadblocks and things that slow down the release process
* Instead of manual inefficient processes helps create fully streamline processes for release cycles 

Different companies implemented DevOps in different ways
But gradually it got a more concrete form with common patterns

* Source code management
* Planning & Collaboration
* Package Management
* Treat Infrastructure as Code
* Cloud
* Continious Monitoring
* Container Orchestration
* Continious integration/deployment

DevOps evolved into an actual role : "DevOps Enginner"
Where either Developpers, Operations or a separate role is responsible for DevOps
DevOps tools : Set of technoligies used to implement the DevOps principles became Devops technologies 
DevOps Engineer responsible for creating a streamlined fully automated release process.

The DevOps need to know developpement and oprations skills

Devops tools that are known today :

* Git
* Docker
* Terraform / Ansible
* Jenkins / Gitlab
* Kubernetes
* AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
* Prometheus

At the core of DevOps : CI/CD Pipeline for an automated release process.

Commit Code -> Test -> Build -> Push -> Deploy
